# SocialMedia-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project we will be visualizing youtube trends, netflix data visualization and the data visualization of a health breach data set for cyber security. We will make use of tools and languages like python and R.
Given the importance of social media in consumers' lives, businesses flock to social platforms in the hope of connecting with their target customers. Staying updated on the latest social media trends can help fuel your strategy and make you stand out in the crowd.
By visualizing this data we will get an idea about the most popular genres, the most interested age group, the countries where netflix has the most popularity, the growth through years and the content shown. This will not only be beneficial for users but also for business strategies and marketing. Similarly, visualizing youtube data we will analyse the trending channels, views, likes, dislikes, predicting tags etc. 
The Health Breach Dataset will be analyzed using various Statistical and Visualization methods in R language in order to obtain various results including which State in the US has the highest number of Data Breach and many more. 
There will a machine learning algorithm to predict the health breach at a certain location with the help of the previous dataset.
